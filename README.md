# Chip8-Emulator

This is yet another Chip-8 Emulator that I built for educational purposes.
The goal of this project was to learn more about how CPU and memory worked,
as well as getting used to some lower level programming.

Uses [Cowgod's Chip-8 Technical Reference](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM) for opcodes and specifications.

Requires SDL2 Framework to run
